1. Xamarin cannot call localhost API
	In .vs folder in '.vs\config\applicationhost.config' add full binding:
	<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:13121:*" />
	To site CiuchApp.Dashboard (around line: 164)

2. New DB Migration cannot be created
	Set Startup project as CiuchApp.Dashboard
	In Package Manager Console set Default Project as CiuchAPp.DataAccess

3. Apply migration to remote database
	replace DefaultConnection with connection to webio. delete all migrations, remove __migration table, add migration "Initial", update database, remove  production connection string
